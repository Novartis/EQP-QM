If the executables provided here do not work on your machine, please download 
the appropriate binaries for your architecture. Note that EQP is only tested 
with

bedtools version 2.2.15 and
samtools version 0.1.17

Please note: bedtools versions between 2.1.15 and 2.2.24 can be problematic
due to the way unsorted BED files are handled.

EQP should work with bedtools version >= 2.2.24 and samtools versions >= 0.1.17.
