Data provenance of the data in test-files:
- The BAM file sam-files/test-alignment-file.bam consists of genomic
  alignments of a subset of the reads for GEO sample GSM1157925 of
  GEO series GSE47774.
- The counts in directory comparison-counts are the results of running
  EQP-QM on the file sam-files/test-alignment-file.bam. 
- The GTF file gtf-files/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.76-test.gtf is based on the
  human Ensembl 76 GTF file. See also Fiona Cunningham, et al., Ensembl
